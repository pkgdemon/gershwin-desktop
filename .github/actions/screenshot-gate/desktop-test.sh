# desktop-test.sh — the interactive desktop gate, driven entirely from OUTSIDE
# the guest over the QEMU monitor (screendump + sendkey; no mouse, nothing
# installed in-guest). Each numbered step is a gate. In HARD mode (rc) the first
# failure exits non-zero and blocks the publish. In SOFT mode (dev, GATE_SOFT=true)
# failures are recorded, stamped onto the published screenshot in red, and the job
# still succeeds so the dev ISO ships (we investigate from the annotated shot).
#
#   1. desktop rendered  — OCR must find BOTH "System Disk" and "Workspace"
#   2. discover Command  — probe sendkey modifiers until Cmd+R opens the Run…
#                          dialog ("Type the command to execute:")
#   3. close everything  — Cmd+W a few times
#   4. open About        — Cmd+R, type "uitest aboutcomputer", Enter
#   5. About is up       — OCR must find "About This Computer" AND "Workspace"
#                          (the menu bar must still be present at capture time)
#   6. capture           — screendump THIS frame -> screenshot/gershwin-on-<flavor>.png,
#                          the ONLY published screenshot (About This Computer + desktop)
#
# The Command modifier and the About-opening command are the two things that can
# only be confirmed on a real boot, so step 2 auto-probes the modifier and each
# failure prints a precise, actionable reason (wrong modifier vs. uitest/-d).
