## Why Gershwin?

Gershwin offers Workspace, Terminal, TextEdit, System Preferences, a native Window Manager for X11 apps, Global Menu server for GNUstep/X11 apps, and more. 

* Gershwin can be built from source code in less than a few minutes using a First-class Clang/LLVM toolchain.
* The entire system including Window Manager only consumes under 50MB of storage.
* Gershwin is completely self contained from the underlying operating system.
* Local Users and Local Applications are kept separate from Network Users and Network Applications and System Applications.
* Users can install Application bundles without root credentials in the Users folder.
* Applications built using Gershwin and its underlying GNUstep foundation can run on other many operating systems including Windows.
* Multiple versions of core libraries can co-exist to guarantee long term ABI stability.

## Installation and testing

* Gershwin can be installed in under a few minutes by using [gershwin-build](https://github.com/gershwin-desktop/gershwin-build).

* Testers can try a [gershwin-on-freebsd live iso](https://github.com/gershwin-desktop/gershwin-on-freebsd/releases/tag/continuous), [gershwin-on-debian live iso](https://github.com/gershwin-desktop/gershwin-on-debian/releases/tag/continuous), or [gershwin-on-arch live iso](https://github.com/gershwin-desktop/gershwin-on-arch/releases/tag/continuous), or the [GhostBSD Gershwin Community Preview live iso](https://www.ghostbsd.org/download) (out of date).

* GhostBSD users can also install Gershwin by installing following package (currently not up to date):
```
 # pkg install gershwin-desktop
```

## Building the live ISOs

This repository builds the Gershwin live ISOs for several base OSes (FreeBSD,
NextBSD, Debian, Devuan, Arch Linux) from one tree — each on an **rc** and a
**dev** release channel. Every flavor builds inside a container of its own
distribution using that distro's native live-media tooling, then shares one
boot/login/screenshot gate and one publish step.

To **add a new flavor** (e.g. Artix) or change how the ISOs are built, see
**[docs/ADDING-A-FLAVOR.md](docs/ADDING-A-FLAVOR.md)**. (Claude Code users: the
repo also ships an `add-iso-flavor` skill that automates the same procedure.)
